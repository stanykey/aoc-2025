# [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

I've done that year's (2025) challenges for fun and to practice with Rust language without deep performance optimization since I prefer idiomatic and readable code until it really needs to be much faster, so most solutions are quick enough to do a job in seconds under debug build configuration.

### Rules:

- `Rust`
- `Built-in only`
- Try to use as much declarative style as I can :)
- Consistently formatted with `rustfmt` and linted by `clippy` via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html)
